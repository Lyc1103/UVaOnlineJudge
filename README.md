## How To Executive

## If you have the `make` commend :

If your device supports the `make` command, this will be much easier ( because my file name is very long... ).<br>
You can type `make` in Terminal to see the output of all Python files directly.<br>
You can also type in :<br>

> <p>>>>make<br>
> // Output the execution result of *_pfile.c programs </p>
> // Then you can change the test data to get the corresponding output by modifying the *.txt file of the corresponding question number.</p>
> // e.g. (1) change the test data in 11995.txt. (2) make the `make` command. (3)executive .\11995(.exe)</p>

## If you <font color = "red">do not</font> have the `make` commend :

If your device <b><font color = "red">does not</font></b> supports the `make` command, there will be a little inconvenience ( because my file name is very long... ).<br>
For instance, you can type in :<br>

> <p>>>>gcc gcc 11995-I-Can-Guess-the-Data-Structure.c -o 11995 <br>
> // Output the execution result of question 11995 </p>
> // p.s. You need to enter the test data manually.
> or
> <p>>>>gcc gcc 11995-I-Can-Guess-the-Data-Structure_pfile.c -o 11995 <br>
> // Output the execution result of question 11995 </p>
> // p.s. You can just change the test data in 11995.txt to get the results.
